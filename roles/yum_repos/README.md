# yum_repos: Manage yum/dnf repos.

This role can be used to manage all ```yum```/```dnf``` repos on machines,
which need to be linked to official/public repos directly.

Do **not** use this role to link a machine to self-hosted snapshots of repos
or systems like _Pulp_, which can be used to _freeze_ repos.
For _Pulp_ see the ```pulp_client``` role instead.

To make a repository locally (on the machine itself) check ```yum_local``` role instead.

This role will:
 * Manage all ```yum```/```dnf``` repos on hosts.
 * Install configs and GPG key files for repos configured in the ```yum_repos``` variable.  
   See ```group_vars/all/vars.yml``` for defaults.
 * **Delete** the config for any repo not configured in the ```yum_repos``` variable.
 * Will leave unspecified options for repos, configured in the ```yum_repos``` variable, untouched.

Note:
* We do NOT use ```ansible.builtin.yum_repository``` any longer as there is no ```ansible.builtin.dnf_repository``` equivalent for newer distros.
* We do NOT install the _EPEL_ repo using the ```epel-release``` RPM with ```ansible.builtin.package```,
  because on RedHat >= 8.x it will install ```*.repo``` files with broken links and broken paths to GPG key files.

#### Example code snippet for the ```yum_repos``` variable:

In the example below
* The dict key ```rocky9``` must match with the value of ```os_distribution``` in ```group_vars/{{ stack_name }}/vars.yml```.  
  E.g. ```os_distribution: 'rocky9'```
* The ```baseos*``` repos are examples of repos for which many settings are taken/used "as is" and left untouched.
  This allows to OS the provide updates for the ```baseurl```, ```metalink``` or ```mirrorlist``` options.
* The ```epel*``` repos are examples of repos for which everything is configured
  and for which the GPG key file will be downloaded from ```gpgkeysource``` and imported with ```ansible.builtin.rpm_key```
