# RStudio - How to use a local IDE for R to crunch data in R on {{ slurm_cluster_name | capitalize }}

## Introduction

_RStudio_ is an Open Source and free Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for R.
This allows you to work in Graphical User Environment (GUI) in addition to a terminal,
which makes it easier when working with data interactively especially when working with graphs / plots as you can view them directly.
If you work only on the commandline on the cluster, you would have to create a graph/plot there,
copy the image file to your local desktop/laptop and then open the image on your local computer to view the image.

Note that there is also a paid commercial version of RStudio with extra bells and whistles,
but the free version should suffice to work with R on {{ slurm_cluster_name | capitalize }}.

There are several flavors of RStudio and ways to work with them, but we can only support one of them.

## How to NOT use RStudio

Do **not** run the _normal_ a.k.a. non-server version of _RStudio_ on {{ slurm_cluster_name | capitalize }}
sending the graphical (X11) output to your local client computer.
Well, it may "work", but the lag in the GUI will result in a very frustrating experience.

Do **not** run _RStudio server_ on {{ slurm_cluster_name | capitalize }}, which is accessed using your local web browser.
This is a security risk due to the weak security implementation in _RStudio server_.
Therefore we will not install the _server_ edition.

## How to use RStudio

![How to use RStudio](img/rstudio.svg)

You can use RStudio by:

 * Running the _normal_ a.k.a. _desktop_ a.k.a. non-server version of RStudio on your local computer and
 * using the [```remoteR```](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/remotes/index.html) R-package to create an R-session on {{ slurm_cluster_name | capitalize }}
 * off loading the data processing from your local computer to {{ slurm_cluster_name | capitalize }} via the remote R-session created with ```remoteR```

This setup will ensure:

 * The original data sets can stay on {{ slurm_cluster_name | capitalize }}
 * Communication between your local client computer and {{ slurm_cluster_name | capitalize }} is encrypted via the SSH protocol.
 * Code to crunch data can be written on your local client and will be send to {{ slurm_cluster_name | capitalize }} for analysis of the data sets.
 * Result files also stay on {{ slurm_cluster_name | capitalize }}.

Data access policies may differ, but in most cases it is allowed to download aggregate results to your local client.
E.g. if you create a bar plot of the median of variable X for different cohorts, this will not contain any data for an individual sample.
Using RStudio to look at such a plot would be compatible with such a data access policy.

Note that if you include measurements for individual samples to the plot - e.g. you include outliers and label them with sample IDs - 
then you may not be allowed to download that to your local computer.

#### 1. Install software on your own computer

 * Install libsodium
    * For Linux and Windows computers see the [libsodium documentation](https://doc.libsodium.org/)
    * For macOS computers install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) if you do not already have it
      and install ```libsodium``` in a terminal with this command

             brew install libsodium

 * [Install both R and RStudio desktop](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)
 * Install a set of compilers and standard libraries, so you can compile R packages from source code
    * For Linux: consult the documentation of your distro.
    * For Windows: install [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/)
    * For macOS: install _Xcode_ either from the App store or using the ```xcode-select --install``` command in the _Terminal_.

#### 2. Login on {{ slurm_cluster_name | capitalize }}

[Login on {{ slurm_cluster_name | capitalize }} with your SSH client](../logins/)

#### 3. Create a screen or tmux session on {{ slurm_cluster_name | capitalize }}

Optionally start a ```screen``` or ```tmux``` session.  
Working with ```screen``` or ```tmux``` is beyond the scope of this documentation, but highly recommended.
It allows you to disconnect from {{ slurm_cluster_name | capitalize }} while leaving your session running,
so you can re-login and re-connect later.
Without ```screen``` or ```tmux``` a dropped network connection will result in loosing the session and loosing any unsaved work in it.

There is a good article [How to Use Linuxâ€™s screen Command](https://www.howtogeek.com/662422/how-to-use-linuxs-screen-command/) on the _How-To Geek website_.
Use the ```-S``` argument to give your ```screen``` session a name. E.g. to create one named ```rstudio```:
```bash
screen -S rstudio
```


#### 4. Create an interactive Slurm session on {{ slurm_cluster_name | capitalize }}

See [Crunch - How to manage jobs on {{ slurm_cluster_name | capitalize }}](../analysis/) for details.  
Simple example requesting a single core and 1 GB RAM memory for max one hour:
```bash
srun --cpus-per-task=1 --mem=1gb --nodes=1 --qos=interactive --time=01:00:00 --pty bash -i
```

#### 5. Load and start R in your interactive Slurm session on {{ slurm_cluster_name | capitalize }}

```bash
module load RPlus
R
```
If you loaded ```RPlus``` in the previous step this contains a _bare_ ```R``` version
and a large list of R packages including ```remoteR``` and its dependencies.
If you prefer to load a _bare_ ```R``` installation and manage your own list of R packages you will need to 
install the [```remoteR``` R-package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/remotes/index.html)
and its dependencies in your R session yourself using:
```R
install.packages('sodium')
# Latest release no longer available from CRAN.
#install.packages('remoter')
# Workaround: install latest release from GitHub
install.packages('remotes')
library('remotes')
remotes::install_github('wrathematics/argon2', ref = github_release())
remotes::install_github('RBigData/remoter', ref = github_release())
```
When you are asked if you would like to install in your own ```library``` folder, then answer ```yes```.

#### 6. Start a remoteR server session in your R session on {{ slurm_cluster_name | capitalize }}

Generate a random password to secure your ```remoteR``` session and start ```remoteR``` in _server mode_.
```R
library('sodium')
library('remoter')
remoter_session_password <- rawToChar(as.raw(sample(c(65:90,97:122), 10, replace=T)))
message(sprintf('Your password for remoteR is: %s', remoter_session_password))
remoter::server(verbose = TRUE, password = remoter_session_password, secure=TRUE)
```
The ```remoteR``` package will now create a session and report on which machine it is running and which port it selected.
Each session needs its own unique port and ```remoteR``` will automatically select one that is free.
You will need this port number and the machine name later on when creating the SSH tunnel...  
E.g.:
```R
[2023-05-10 12:05:47]: *** Launching secure server ***
                       Hostname:     gs-vcompute07
                       Port:         55555
```
Optionally in case you are running this inside ```screen```:  
Now press ```CTRL+a``` followed by ```CTRL+d``` to detach from the ```screen```.
The ```R``` session inside the interactive Slurm job inside the ```screen``` session will continue to run in the background.
You can reconnect to the existing screen session using ```-r``` argument and the name of the ```screen``` session.  
E.g.:
```bash
screen -r rstudio
```

#### 7. Create an SSH tunnel on your own computer

Now we need to create an SSH tunnel from your local client computer to the server and connect to the remote R session.

###### For Windows clients

The instructions below we assume you use _MobaXterm_ to connect to {{ slurm_cluster_name | capitalize }} as described in
[SSH config and login to UI via Jumphost for users on Windows](../logins-windows/).

![configure MobaSSHTunnel](img/MobaSSHTunnel1.png)

 * 1: Select _**MobaSSHTunnel**_ from the _**Tools**_ menu.

![configure MobaSSHTunnel](img/MobaSSHTunnel2.png)

 * 2: Click the _**New SSH tunnel**_ button.

![configure MobaSSHTunnel](img/MobaSSHTunnel3.png)

 * In the popup window fill in / select:
    * 3: _**Local port forwarding**_
    * 4: _Remote server_ field: The _**hostname**_ of the _compute node_ where ```remoteR``` is running.
    * 5: _Remote port_ field: The _**port number**_ chosen by ```remoteR``` on the server side.
    * 6: _SSH server_ field: Use _jumphost_ address _**{{ first_jumphost_address }}**_
    * 7: _SSH login_ field: Use your _**account name**_ as you received it by email from the helpdesk.
    * 8: _SSH port_ field: _**22**_
    * 9: _Forwarded port_ field: The _**port number**_ you chose on the client side.  
      For the _Forwarded port_ you have to chose a free port yourself.
      Hence, it must be a port that is not yet used by another process.
      We suggest you simply try to use the same number as the one that ```remoteR``` selected on the server side.
      If that one does not work because it is already taken, simply increment by one and retry until you found one that is free.
    * 10: Click the _**Save**_ button.

![configure MobaSSHTunnel](img/MobaSSHTunnel4.png)

 * 11: Give the tunnel config a _**name**_.
 * 12: Click the key icon to select your _**private key file**_.
 * 13: Click the _**play**_ button to start the SSH tunnel.

###### For Linux & macOS clients

Use the ```ssh``` command in a terminal to create an SSH tunnel from your local machine via _jumphost_ {{ groups['jumphost'] | first }}
to the {{ slurm_cluster_name | capitalize }} _compute node_ on which ```remoteR``` is running in your interactive Slurm session.
The general syntax is
```bash
ssh -N -L localhost:<port_number_on_client>:localhost:<port_number_on_server> {{ groups['jumphost'] | first }}+<hostname_of_remoter_server>
```
The example below uses the same port number on the client side as the one chosen by ```remoteR``` on the server side.
```bash
ssh -N -L localhost:55555:localhost:55555 airlock+gs-vcompute07
```
If you get a message like this:
```bash
bind [127.0.0.1]:55555: Address already in use
channel_setup_fwd_listener_tcpip: cannot listen to port: 55555
Could not request local forwarding.
```
then the selected port on the client side is not free and already used by another process.
Try the next port number until you find one that is free: in that case you will not get any message.
```bash
ssh -N -L localhost:55556:localhost:55555 airlock+gs-vcompute07
```

#### 8. Install remoteR in RStudio on your own computer

Start RStudio, go to the _Console_ tab and install the
[sodium](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sodium/index.html) and
[remoteR](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/remotes/index.html) R-packages
with these commands
```R
install.packages('sodium')
# Latest release remoteR no longer available from CRAN.
#install.packages('remoter')
# Workaround: install latest release from GitHub
install.packages('remotes')
library('remotes')
remotes::install_github('wrathematics/argon2', ref = github_release())
remotes::install_github('RBigData/remoter', ref = github_release())
```

#### 9. Using the remote R session in RStudio on your own computer

![use RStudio on your own computer](img/RStudio.png)

In _RStudio_ on your own computer you can now connect to the remote R session using:
```R
library('sodium')
library('remoter')
remoter::client('localhost', port = port_number_on_client, password = '******')
```
* Replace ```port_number_on_client``` with the port number you chose for the SSH tunnel on the client side
* Replace ```******``` with the password generated on the server side when starting the ```remoteR``` session.

###### Creating plots

To make plots you have to call ```dev.off()``` after each plot you make.
This is the signal for the ```remoteR``` package to send your plot to your local computer.

The default resolution of the plots is quite low.
This can be resolved by increasing the _width_ and _height_ before each plot.
E.g. something like this
```R
rpng(width = 1000, height = 1000)
```

An example plot to test the plotting functionality can be created with
```R
rpng(width = 1000, height = 1000)
dat<- data.frame(t=seq(0, 2*pi, by=0.1) )
xhrt <- function(t) 16*sin(t)^3
yhrt <- function(t) 13*cos(t)-5*cos(2*t)-2*cos(3*t)-cos(4*t)
dat$y=yhrt(dat$t)
dat$x=xhrt(dat$t)
with(dat, plot(x,y, type="l"))
with(dat, polygon(x,y, col="hotpink"))   
points(c(10,-10, -15, 15), c(-10, -10, 10, 10), pch=169, font=5)
dev.off()
```

#### 10. Cleaning up

**Donâ€™t keep R running forever on {{ slurm_cluster_name | capitalize }}!**
Make sure to really exit your session on {{ slurm_cluster_name | capitalize }} when you are done to prevent wasting resources,
which is not nice for others waiting in the queue.

 * Without ```screen```:  
   Use ```q()``` to quit the ```R``` session, type ```exit``` or ```CTRL+x``` to exit your interactive Slurm job.
 * With ```screen```:  
   First re-attach to your screen session if you were detached.
   Next, use ```q()``` to quit the ```R``` session, type ```exit``` or ```CTRL+x``` to exit ```screen``` and another ```exit``` or ```CTRL+x``` to exit your interactive Slurm job.
