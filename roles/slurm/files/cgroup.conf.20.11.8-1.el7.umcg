# Lustre / GPFS / NFS clients or daemons tend to use large buffers allocated in kernel memory space.
# Those buffers count as kernel memory used by the cgroup of a job.
# Unaware users might have their jobs exceed this kernel memory limit simply by reading large files.
# The "plain RAM" limit is not affected by this option.
# Note: we limit the total amount of RAM that can be assigned to Slurm jobs to be less than the system total
# in the slurm.conf file to make sure the OS, file system daemons, etc. have enough RAM available.

# Don't let Slurm jobs swap as swapping kills performance taking the H out of HPC.

# Bind job tasks to a subset of the allocated cores using sched_setaffinity
# to prevent them from swapping to other cores during job execution,
# which would decrease performance.
# Requires the Portable Hardware Locality (hwloc) library.
#
# NOTE: Due to bugs in hwloc:
# It is recommended to stack task/affinity,task/cgroup together when configuring TaskPlugin in slurm.conf
# combined with setting TaskAffinity=no and ConstrainCores=yes in cgroup.conf.
# This setup uses the task/affinity plugin for setting the affinity of the tasks
# (which is better and different than task/cgroup)
# and uses the task/cgroup plugin to fence tasks into the specified resources,
# thus combining the best of both pieces.
TaskAffinity=no
