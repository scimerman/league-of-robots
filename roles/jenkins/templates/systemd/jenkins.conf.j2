# Set the umask to control the permission bits of files that Jenkins creates.
#
# 0027 makes files read-only for group and inaccessible for others, which some
# security sensitive users might consider beneficial, especially if Jenkins
# is running on a server that is used for multiple purposes. Beware that 0027
# permissions would interfere with sudo scripts that run on the controller
# (see JENKINS-25065).
#
# Note also that the particularly sensitive parts of $JENKINS_HOME (such as
# credentials) are always written without 'other' access. So the umask values
# only affect job configuration, build records, etc.
#
# If unset, the value from the OS is inherited, which is normally 0022.
# The default umask comes from pam_umask(8) and /etc/login.defs.
